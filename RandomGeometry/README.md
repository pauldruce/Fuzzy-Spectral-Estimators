# Random Fuzzy Spaces Spectra

These folders contain the ensemble-averaged eigenvalues for the random fuzzy spaces.

The simulation outlined and analysed in ([1] and [2]) can produce many Dirac operators $D_i$, as you can repeatedly sample the simulation after it has thermalised. These Dirac operators each have a set of eigenvalues $\{\lambda^{(i)}_j\}_{j=1}^{n}$ (where $n$ here is the total number of eigenvalues for the Dirac operator $D_i$). You can calculate the spectral dimension and spectral variance for each of the Dirac operators that you sample from the simulation and then analyse the resulting data. However, for a personal computer (as opposed to the high performance computer that these simulations are ran on), this is very resource heavy and can take a very long time to complete. So the data provided here is the weighted-average of the eigenvalues from the simulation. Thus for each Clifford-type and for each value of the coupling constant $g_2$, there is only one set of eigenvalues for each of the matrix sizes the simulation investigated. 

The consequences of taking this average were examined in [3].
